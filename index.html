                            Seeks to address whether each state has been overrepresented or underrepresented in the electoral college based on overall population between 1960 and 2015.  The overall message is that less populous states are generally more overrepresented and more populous states are usually underrepresented.  Further, states usually tend to be underrepresented by a much larger margin than those who are overrepresented.  Lastly, each state appears to have generally remained either overrepresented or underrepresented between 1960 and 2016, with very few states ever crossing over between the two.

                            Readers can see whether a particular state has been over or underrepresented in the electoral college in general from 1960-2016, identifying extremes to see which states are the most over/underrepresented.  Further, readers can see how the population and representation in the electoral college of each state has changed over time by comparing the distance from the center line over time.  By comparing the amount of over and underrepresentation in a particular state with that state’s general voting habits, a reader can determine what kind of impact that representation would have on an election.

                            This visualization is good because it presents important, factual data in a way that is easy to read and understand.  It provides insight into the workings of the electoral college, which is very important to the foundation of this country. Each of the five principles of visualization are well-addressed in this visualization, making it effective overall.

                            I think this visualization is bad because it prevents the data in a very confusing way due to the overlap between the squares.  The data is distorted since some squares which are actually larger look smaller since they are mostly covered by another square.  Also, this particular presentation makes it difficult to see the bell-curve like trend that defines the data.  Also, the lack of labels on the visualization itself make the chart hard to analyze, as the reader has to continue looking back and forth between the key and the chart.
