                            Seeks to address whether each state has been overrepresented or underrepresented in the electoral college based on overall population between 1960 and 2015.  The overall message is that less populous states are generally more overrepresented and more populous states are usually underrepresented.  Further, states usually tend to be underrepresented by a much larger margin than those who are overrepresented.  Lastly, each state appears to have generally remained either overrepresented or underrepresented between 1960 and 2016, with very few states ever crossing over between the two.

                            Readers can see whether a particular state has been over or underrepresented in the electoral college in general from 1960-2016, identifying extremes to see which states are the most over/underrepresented.  Further, readers can see how the population and representation in the electoral college of each state has changed over time by comparing the distance from the center line over time.  By comparing the amount of over and underrepresentation in a particular state with that state’s general voting habits, a reader can determine what kind of impact that representation would have on an election.

                            The audience for this visualization is those affected by the corona virus pandemic, which is the general population. This was published in the New York times and is specifically geared towards those who are reentering social scenes as Covid restrictions loosen.  Additionally, the information in this graphic is also available in German, Portuguese, Serbian and Spanish.

                            It informs the viewer of the level of risk different activities have in relation to contracting the Covid 19 pandemic. It sorts activities by risk level and also gives the viewer additional risk factors to be aware of.

                            The data encoded in the visualization is on different settings and their associated risk factor for contracting Covid 19, as well as different factors that contribute to overall risk level.

                            The reader is able to identify activities that are more and less risky in association to contracting Covid 19. For example, a reader can quickly recognize that tennis, outdoor exercise and takeout food are some of the least risky activities whereas going to a night club is a slight outlier in the sense that it is the riskiest activity which is demonstrated by the fact it is the biggest circle and the darkest shade of red on the visualization.

For some activities, the visualization provided additional details on why it is categorized the way it is, such as the beach being low risk, but only if you are able to social distance.

                            This is a good visualization for multiple reasons. First, the visualization is visually appealing and easy to understand through use of color, positioning and clear labels. It also does more than just showcase which activities are risky – it tells you why for activities that are confusing and also lists risk factors to consider that contribute to the riskiness of each activity. The visual gives the viewer a better understanding of why an activity is risky. This visualization is also very useful. In a time when the country is reopening but the virus still looms large, having an understanding of the risk associated with different activities is very helpful.

                            Readers compare the sizes of each square in order to determine how many more people spend a certain amount of money on groceries than another amount.  Even though this visualization makes it difficult to see, readers should be able to see the sort of bell-curve like trend in the data, with more people spending more middle-tier amounts of money than either of the extremes.

                            I think this visualization is bad because it prevents the data in a very confusing way due to the overlap between the squares.  The data is distorted since some squares which are actually larger look smaller since they are mostly covered by another square.  Also, this particular presentation makes it difficult to see the bell-curve like trend that defines the data.  Also, the lack of labels on the visualization itself make the chart hard to analyze, as the reader has to continue looking back and forth between the key and the chart.

                                <li><span class = "list-element">Truthful: </span> This visualization is not all truthful. Though it does disclose its sources, which are guardian data store, Starbucks and calorie-counter.com, the graphic’s title “the buzz vs the bulge” does nothing to imply that the coffee calorie which is being listed is based only off Starbucks’s coffee, which has more added sugar than other brands, and this nuance is not easily identifiable to the reader. Additionally, the x and y axis can be misleading. The center point to this graph is (150,150). It is confusing to understand the context of this in the graph and makes it more difficult to read the different calorie and caffeine associations with different objects. For example, energy drinks are very close to the x axis and from first glance one may assume that it’s calorie count is close to 0, however it is actually close to 200 calories. The axis labels are somewhat untruthful in the sense that it may distort the meaning of the data. </li>
                                <li><span class = "list-element">Functional: </span> This visualization is not the most functional. The graph is somewhat cluttered with over 40 data points, and many of them are repeating the same drink in the different sizes or are foods that are not directly related to the topic of the visualization, such as big macs and fries. Additionally, there are many data points on the graph which are the same silhouette. For example, the large mocha Frappuccino is the same image as the large mocha Frappuccino with whipped cream and there is a coffee mug picture that is used to represent 7 different drinks. As a result, the pictures themselves are not very useful. The labels are very small and you have to zoom in to read them which makes it hard to understand the bigger picture. Contributing to the same problem of not being able to understand the big picture, the viewer is not able to see the whole visualization on one web page because it is so large and cluttered with data.

For example, the person would be able to see an iced coffee provides the highest amount of caffeine with the lowest number of calories.</li>
                                <li><span class = "list-element">Enlightening: </span> This visualization is not very enlightening. Though it can help someone to understand how much caffeine and calories are in a particular food or drink, it is also not very easy to apply to coffee in general, since the data is only taken from Starbucks coffee. Additionally, it would be hard to use this to guide any life style changes since in some cases the visualization includes the size of the drink and in some cases, it doesn’t. Though the visualization is interesting to look at and think about it lacks practical use that could make it enlightening.

                            This visualization is a bad one. It is not entirely truthful, since the data source is misleading and does not tell the viewer the calories for coffee are only pulled from Starbucks. Additionally, the graph is cluttered and difficult to read. The x and y axis intersect at (150, 150) which adds to the confusion in reading it and the images for different coffees are repeated making them unhelpful in decoding the graph.
